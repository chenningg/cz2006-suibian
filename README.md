# Deploying server code

To update the application code, you must be a contributor of this repository. Create a new branch and submit a pull request for the master branch. Once approved, your code will automatically be deployed to Heroku.

Please make sure your code works before deploying to master. You should test your code on a local server localhost:3000 to make sure everything is functioning correctly first.

# Getting started

### Installation

Open a terminal instance and cd to the root directory. In the root directory, type `yarn install` . This is a mono-repo format where the common modules will be installed in the root folder directory and the more specific modules are installed in the respective packages.

### Testing local setup

After the node modules is installed, run `yarn start` in both suibian-server and suibian-app to get it working.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The app is being served via a http proxy to the express server which serves the react app.

# React commands

The react application can be run from either the root directory or the suibian-app directory under packages.

## Root directory
